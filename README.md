# ERP SYSTEM

The main conceptual idea of the ERP System is based on web
application that provides a simple interface for maintenance of
different student, faculty, attendance, exam, lectures, fees and
other information. It automates the existing manual system by
the help of computerized equipments and full-fledged computer
software, so that the valuable data can be stored for a longer
period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same.

ERP systems can lead to error-free, secure, reliable, and fast management systems. The system allows the admin to manage students, faculties, exams, and other information. Our system allows a faculty to input student attendance into the database which can later be viewed by students and faculties. The students can view their attendance through a separate student login panel. Study materials can also be provided to students by their respected faculty. This System can maintain computerized records without redundant entries. That means that without any distraction one is able to reach the information.
